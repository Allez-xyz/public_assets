You retain full responsibility and control over how you use our dashboards, vault configurations, advice or tools. Without limitation, Allez Labs is not authorised or regulated by the UK FCA, the U.S. SEC, or any equivalent authority.

   3. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Allez Labs may revise, disable, suspend or discontinue all or part of the Services at any time. You acknowledge that the scope and nature of the Services may evolve, and that new features or products will be considered part of the Services and subject to these Terms, unless stated otherwise.

2. **Eligibility and access**

   2. You must comply with all applicable laws, regulations and restrictions when using the Services. You are solely responsible for determining the legality of your actions in your jurisdiction, including any DeFi-related transactions or interactions. You further represent that your professional knowledge is sufficient to evaluate DeFi risks without reliance on Allez Labs.

3. **Use of analytics tools**

   1. Allez Labs offers dashboards, models and metrics (the “analytics tools”) which are provided ‘as is’ for informational purposes only. We do not guarantee accuracy, completeness or timeliness of any data or output.

   2. You must not: 

      1. reverse-engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code or underlying processes of the analytics tools; 

      2. copy, reproduce, redistribute or exploit any analytics output for commercial purposes without prior written consent; 

      3. use automated means (including bots or scripts) to scrape, crawl or harvest data from the Services without prior written consent; or

      4. rely on the analytics tools as the sole basis for financial, legal or other decisions. Reliance is at your own risk.

   3. Allez Labs may remove, disable or modify analytics tools at any time. We are not obliged to maintain or update them unless explicitly agreed in writing.

   4. If you publish or redistribute any analytics in compliance with these Terms, you must include a clear ‘as is / no reliance’ notice and bind the recipient to disclaimers no less protective than those in these Terms.

4. **Vault and market use**

   1. Allez Labs is not a custodian and does not hold, manage, or secure user assets. We are not a fiduciary, broker, investment adviser, or asset manager. Your interaction with vaults or markets is entirely at your own risk.

   2. While we do not hold or transfer user funds, we configure smart contracts that actively allocate liquidity to DeFi markets and periodically adjust on chain risk parameters (interest rates, collateral thresholds, incentive weights and similar settings).

   3. We have no contractual obligation to you, any vault user, or any other third party arising from providing vault or market services unless otherwise noted. You alone decide whether the risk-reward profile is acceptable.

   4. Allez Labs may simultaneously serve as a service provider to protocols and offer vault tooling or parameterisation services. You acknowledge that potential conflicts of interest may arise, and Allez Labs is not obligated to prioritise your interests over its own or those of its other clients.

   5. You acknowledge that: 

      1. digital assets may lose some or all of their value;

      2. vault outcomes, including yields or losses, are subject to volatility, code exploits, liquidity shortfalls, and other risks beyond our control; 

      3. you bear full responsibility for initiating, monitoring, and unwinding positions within the vault smart contracts and markets;

      4. smart contracts may contain bugs, logic errors or vulnerabilities that can lead to partial or total asset loss;

      5. Allez Labs does not guarantee any specific level of return or profit;

      6. while Allez Labs aims to configure vault strategies to optimise performance, we do not guarantee the accuracy, reliability, or predictive power of our analytics. These models are experimental. All modelling outputs are subject to uncertainty, and we cannot guarantee against losses resulting from our vaults due to our allocation strategy;

      7. in addition to configuring vaults, Allez Labs may directly manage, deploy, and parameterise lending markets. While we apply research-driven modelling and best efforts to configure these markets for optimal risk-reward outcomes, we cannot guarantee that deposited assets will be free from losses. Depositing users bear the full risk of loss and should exercise independent judgment; and

      8. you will make your own risk-reward decisions based on your own informed market perspectives.

   6. Any performance fees or other vault related fees that accrue to Allez Labs are irrevocable and non-refundable once paid on chain or otherwise settled.

   7. We may pause, modify or discontinue any vault strategy, parameter set or incentive schedule at any time, with or without notice, and have no continuing obligation to maintain, update or support any vault and you will not be entitled to any refund of fees already paid or to any compensation for unrealised yield.
